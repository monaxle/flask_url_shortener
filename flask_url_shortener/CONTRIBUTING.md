### Contributing Guidelines!

 Read this space to know the contributing guidelines. Please follow the guidelines for smooth contribution. Following the guidelines reflect your courtesy towards the open source contribution.

### Expected Contribution:
In case you are willing to contribute in any form, You're most welcome! Improvement in documentation, reporting bugs and mistakes is expected in general.

# Getting started

## Ground Rules
Issues should be created to submit a change to the repository before opening a pull request. Communication in any form except the repository channels is not expected.

## How to Contribute:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account through the GitHub UI. As of September 2020, the button to fork is in the top right corner of the page.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine in order to make edits, build, test, and generally do software development. To clone to your local computer, you will need the git repository URL. GitHub provides it for you through the UI by clicking the green Code button, at the top of the file list in the code tab on the repository. Copy that URL, and then use it to run the git clone command in a terminal on your computer to clone a local copy to work on.
```
$ git clone "https://www.github.com/{Username}/{Repository}"
```
where username is your GitHub account username.

3. Create a branch where you can do your local work.
Never work on **master** branch.
```
$ git branch {branchname}
$ git checkout branchname
```

4. Add your work and stage your changes.
```
$ git add <filename>
```

5. Commit you changes with a commit message containing your name, file(s) worked upon, what the commit changed and/or why it changed
```
$ git commit -m "Name| files| Changes"
```

6. Push changes to your forked repository
```
$ git push -u origin branchname
```
7. Create a pull request to the upstream repository. To create your pull request, go back to your repository in the GitHub UI, and open the Pull Requests tab. Then click on the New pull request button near the top right of the screen. You will have a chance to change where to send this pull request. This is important to check when you're working with branches.

## Synchronize forked repository with Upstream repository

1. Create upstream as our repository
```
$ git remote add upstream {Repository Link}
```

2. Fetch upstream changes in local machine
```
$ git fetch upstream
```

3. Switch to master branch
```
$ git checkout master
```

4. Merge changes in local machine
```
$ git merge upstream/master
```

5. Push changes to your forked GitHub repository
```
$ git push -f origin master
```
